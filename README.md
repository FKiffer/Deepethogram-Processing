# Deepethogram-Processing
Simple scripts to quickly process the output files from deepethogram with the most common behavioral measures, validated in python 3.9

One File at a Time.py is to be used.. you guessed it, on a single file at a time

All files.py is to be used in a folder conatining all output csv files. It generates a new csv for each type of behavioral measure with data neatly tabulated. When ran, this prompts two pop-up windows: the first is for the folder containing all of your output csv files, and the second to the folder you wish the new tabulated csv files to be saved in. It's a good idea to create an empty folder to save the new csv files in.
